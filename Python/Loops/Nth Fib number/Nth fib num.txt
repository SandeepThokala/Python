# What is the Fibonacci series ? It is a series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number )

# is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.


# Write a function fib (n) that takes in a number and returns the nth Fibonacci number



def fib (n) :

    a = 1

    b = 1

    for i in range(0,n - 2):

        a = a + b

        b = a - b

    return  b
